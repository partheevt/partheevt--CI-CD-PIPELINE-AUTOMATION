Car Management System - CI/CD Pipeline

Overview

This repository contains the CI/CD pipeline setup for the Car Management System, which includes automation for used car sales, new car sales, and accessories management. The project is implemented in PHP and runs locally during development.

Pipeline Workflow

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure seamless development and deployment. Below is an overview of the workflow:

1. Continuous Integration (CI)

Code Checkout: The pipeline triggers on push or pull request events.

Dependency Installation: Installs required dependencies using Composer.

Code Quality Checks: Runs linters and static analysis tools.

Unit Testing: Executes PHPUnit tests to verify functionality.

Security Scanning: Performs security checks on dependencies and codebase.

2. Continuous Deployment (CD)

Build Process: Prepares application artifacts for deployment.

Staging Deployment: Deploys the application to a staging environment for testing.

Automated Testing: Runs integration and functional tests in the staging environment.

Production Deployment: Upon approval, deploys the latest changes to the production environment.

GitHub Actions Workflow

The pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions and is defined in the .github/workflows/cicd.yml file.

Example Workflow File:

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.1'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist

      - name: Run Code Quality Checks
        run: php vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=5 src/

      - name: Run Tests
        run: php vendor/bin/phpunit

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Server
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
          # Add deployment scripts here

Deployment Process

Push code changes to the repository.

The CI/CD pipeline runs automated checks.

Upon successful testing, the code is deployed to the staging environment.

After validation, production deployment is triggered manually or automatically based on workflow configuration.

Requirements

PHP 8.1+

Composer

PHPUnit

GitHub Actions configured with appropriate secrets for deployment
